Null Hypothesi(?)
  1. Should be no difference in rates for different types of pet
  2. Should have no difference in rates between different locations
  3. Should have no difference in rates over time
  4. Should have no difference in rates between email and no email

T-Test is difference between 2 means
  - use p-value, the odds of getting the result if the null hypothesis is true, to tell the signficance
  - smaller the p-value (<.05), then less likely to get results, so then the null hypothesis is not true
