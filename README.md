## Project Title:  Animal Welfare Outcomes

**Description:**  
Analyze shelter animal statistics for trends in adoption, euthanasia, and return to owner

**Data:**	
Illinois Department of Agriculture Animal Shelter license renewal sheets
Shelter Animals Count Data

**3-5 Initial research questions:**

1)	 Differences between adoption, euthanasia, and return to owner rates between different kinds of pets.
     - Bar Graphs for volume
     - Pie Graphs for percentages
2)	 The effect of location on volume of adoption, euthanasia, and return to owner rates.  Which counties have the highest/lower amount, does this have correlation to population size or income levels?
     - Bubble chart
3)	Illinois trends for intake, adoption, return to owner, and euthanasia over time.
     - Line graph 
4)	Does listing a business email have any effects of rates?
     - see if there is a correlation

**Techniques & tools:**

Excel, Pandas, Matplotlab, Numpy

**Data Shortcomings:**
-	Accuracy and participation of self-reported data
-	Lack of standardization and verification for information
